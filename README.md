A set of forex trading instructions and Expert Advisors for MT4

1- Our trading infra structure:

A- Machine No.1 the "trading machine"
We use a Linux server ( fedora 23 is recommended ) as our trading machine which is supposed to be located on a data center close to the market or broker servers. There are lots of companies and businesses around who provide you with a proper service of this type and you can get various types and levels of these services with diferent fees. you can find these services by simply googling the keywords "VPS in new york city", "hire cloud servers", "servers suitable for trade" or similar keywords. When hiring these services have in mind that the most important factors of a server for trading purposes are its network-delay to your brokers server and its stability (it must have less than 10ms delay and must be 24/7 always online and connected to network). You should be able to hire a server with less than 10ms ping-time delay to your brokers server by something less than 50$ per month. If price or ping time differ very much from this, you are probably on a wrong track.

B- Machines No.2 and 3,4 ... so on 
These machines are normal clients probably laptops, Desktops, Mobile phones or any other kind of device capable of running a MT4 client. we recommend Fedora on a laptop for the client( FAQ: will I be able to use fedora for normal daily computing usage? YES! You can). this machine might run any OS , but we recommend linux and we put instructions for linux. If you are using windows that is ok, but your commands and settings may differ a little bit.
